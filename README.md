# Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Python

## Overview

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral. It uses real-time data fetched from Twitter and applies natural language processing to understand public sentiment around a specific topic.

## What is Sentiment Analysis?

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the computational process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words. Itâ€™s commonly used to identify and extract subjective information in text data. In this context, it helps understand how people feel about a specific topic or individual based on their tweets.

## Applications

- **Business**: Brands use sentiment analysis to monitor customer opinions, optimize marketing strategies, and analyze campaign effectiveness.
- **Politics**: It helps analyze public opinion on political parties, monitor the consistency of political statements, and even predict election outcomes.
- **Public Monitoring**: Useful in understanding general sentiment during social events, emergencies, or public discussions.

## Workflow

1. **Authentication**: Connect to the Twitter API using access tokens to fetch real-time tweets based on a search query.
2. **Tweet Preprocessing**: Clean tweets by removing links, special characters, and user mentions.
3. **Sentiment Classification**: Use natural language processing to analyze the sentiment of each tweet.
4. **Analysis**: Calculate and display the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral tweets. Showcase some sample tweets under each category.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- **Twitter API**: To fetch real-time tweets based on a given topic.
- **TextBlob**: For processing text and classifying sentiment.
- **Tweepy**: A Python library for accessing the Twitter API.
- **NLTK**: Provides corpora and additional language processing tools used by TextBlob.

## Highlights

- Clean and efficient text preprocessing
- Real-time tweet analysis
- Visual summary of sentiment distribution
- Extensible for various topics or domains

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how sentiment analysis can be applied to social media data to extract valuable insights. By automating the process of understanding public opinion, it offers a useful tool for individuals and organizations looking to make data-driven decisions.
